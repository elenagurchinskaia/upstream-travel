## Learning points

We learned and had a lot of fun with this project. A few learning moments stand out
- How long it takes to set up and call a new API's depends on the documentation
- Determine what the costs and abilities of an API before committing to it
- Always check within what scope variables and functions are placed
- Be aware of timing for API fetch calls and event listeners
